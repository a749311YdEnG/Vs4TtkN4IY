Web Content Scraper Pyramid Application
=====================================

This application is a simple Pyramid web application that scrapes content from a given webpage.

Usage:
- Start the Pyramid development server by running `pserve development.ini` in the terminal, where `development.ini` is the configuration file for the Pyramid application.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:6543/scrape/<URL>` in your web browser, replacing `<URL>` with the URL of the webpage you want to scrape.

The application will return the content of the webpage as a JSON response.

Error Handling:
- The application includes basic error handling to catch and return errors that may occur during the scraping process.

Maintenance and Extensibility:
- The code is well-structured and includes comments to make it easy to understand and maintain.
- It is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features or modifications to the existing functionality.
